Android Camera App with Tesseract OCR
This Android app demonstrates the integration of a camera feature along with Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to capture an image and extract text content from it. 
The app showcases how to use the device's camera to capture an image, process it using Tesseract OCR, and display the extracted text.

Features
Utilizes the device's camera to capture an image.
Integrates Tesseract OCR to extract text content from images.
Displays both the captured image and the extracted text on the user interface.
Handles camera permission requests and image capture flow.
Provides a seamless and intuitive user experience.

How It Works
Camera Access: The app first requests camera permission from the user to access the device's camera.
Image Capture: Once permission is granted, the user can capture an image using the device's camera.
Tesseract OCR: The app uses Tesseract OCR to process the captured image and extract text content from it.
Display Results: The extracted text is displayed on the app's user interface, along with the captured image.

This project serves as an example of integrating camera functionality and OCR in an Android app. 
It's a useful learning resource for those interested in mobile app development, camera access, and text extraction using Tesseract OCR.
Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project to further enhance your Android development skills.
